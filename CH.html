    <h2>2. What is a CPU and what does it do? </h2>
        <p>The CPU of a computer is the brains of the computer.  CPU stands for <br> Central Processing Unit. The CPU tells the computer what to do when <br> it is given instructions. The order of its operation is fetch, then decode, <br> and finally execute.  During the fetch stage, the CPU gets the information <br> and then it transfers to decoding. Decodingis when the information is <br> broken down into steps, so the computer can understand what to do. <br> Finally the computer executes the order and preforms the task.</p>
